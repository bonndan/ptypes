# PTypes #

PTypes is an experimental implementation of Java-Like String, Float etc. classes for PHP.
The primary motivation is to achieve a certain type safety.

This library was inspired by the String class featured by [MolComponents](https://github.com/Matthimatiker/MolComponents)
and still uses some code of it. It is published under the BSD License.
